## Create a Power BI Dashboard Displaying Waiting Times for Cancer Patients

**Project description:** For this project, I was interested in creating a dashboard that would display the waiting times for NHS patients within England who were suspected of developing cancer. The NHS has a target that 93% of urgent suspected cancer patients should be seen within 14 days, so I designed my dashboard to highlight which trusts were missing and which were meeting the target. I found a data set on the official NHS website at: https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/cancer-waiting-times/monthly-prov-cwt/2021-22-monthly-provider-cancer-waiting-times-statistics/provider-based-cancer-waiting-times-for-march-2021-22-provisional (2. Two Week Wait â€“ All Cancers (Provider Data)).

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
